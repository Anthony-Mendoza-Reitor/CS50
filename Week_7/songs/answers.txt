If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?
Probably averaging the energy, valence, and danceability.

SELECT avg(energy), avg(valence), avg(danceability) FROM songs;
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| avg(energy) | avg(valence) | avg(danceability) |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+
| 0.65906     | 0.484443     | 0.71646           |
+-------------+--------------+-------------------+

Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?
Based on the time they spent listening to the songs. For example if they listen more hours to the top 1 that one should have more weight when it comes to the aura.
